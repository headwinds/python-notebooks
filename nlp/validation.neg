here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha . 
the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . 
as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma . 
our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender  and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here . 
somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates . 
payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 
another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie .

 . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee . 
though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set . 
the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable . 
with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins . 
to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . 
when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '

though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . 
 . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman . 
the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end . 
mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . 
isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it . 
maybe leblanc thought , " hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . " 
barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time
so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
earnest but heavy-handed . 
too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one . 
a punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters . 
the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers . 
sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel . 
one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . 
dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ? 
there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity . 
has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . 
completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . 
there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance . 
adam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . 
the movie is a mess from start to finish . 
i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life . 
the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichs from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
some episodes work , some don't . 
j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . 
not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . 
watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence . 
'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa , pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y , por momentos , deplorable . '
the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . 
full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 
the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes . 
if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . 
everything is pegged into the groove of a new york dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify . 
the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything . 
the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
one lousy movie . 
plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
oozes condescension from every pore . 
the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . 
though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . 
an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .

one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history . 
fear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique . 
thoroughly awful . 
though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch . 
a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses . 
rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr . , but there isn't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative . 
such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 
holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp . 
a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family . 
stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 
there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands . 
it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long . 
such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
the whole affair is as predictable as can be . 
this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell . 
star trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy . 
every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol . 
ver wiel's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless . 
although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . 
'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
the worst film of the year . 
without shakespeare's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish . 
during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' . 
watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied . 
the film can depress you about life itself . 
the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line . 
the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . 
at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer . 
an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets . 
unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 
glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum . 
it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say . 
a big fat pain . 
unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic . 
aan opportunity wasted . 
to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
mild , meandering teen flick . 
though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before . 
astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
cuba gooding jr . valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy . 
not at all clear what it's trying to say and even if it were  i doubt it would be all that interesting . 
[swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
silly , loud and goofy . 
the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 
the pool drowned me in boredom . 
it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one . 
there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . 
the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 
the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid . 
it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda . 
woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
 . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts . 
why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there's no good answer to that one . 
a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms . 
this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 
this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending . 
looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . 
[carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 
this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . 
the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . 
since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 
cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying . 
it's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller . 
 . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 
what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 
it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd . 
hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script . . . that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire . 
and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! 
it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere . 
an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense . 
the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . 
this film biggest problem ? no laughs . 
that the chuck norris " grenade gag " occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is . 
it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental . 
everybody loves a david and goliath story , and this one is told almost entirely from david's point of view . 
eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you don't care who fires the winning shot . 
a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . 
to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again . 
wait for it to hit cable . 
a high-minded snoozer . 
77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling . 
the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus . 
unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes . 
adam sandler's eight crazy nights grows on you -- like a rash . 
few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance . 
the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly . 
a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 
resembles a soft porn brian de palma pastiche . 
innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good . 
woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody . but i had a lot of problems with this movie . 
devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special . 
plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year . 
parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place . 
paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre . 
the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy . 
let's issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prep-school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate . 
alternately frustrating and rewarding . 
despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this . 
the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration . 
suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 . 
yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . but fans of the show should not consider this a diss . consider it 'perfection . '
children and adults enamored of all things pokemon won't be disappointed . 
children of the century , though well dressed and well made , ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers . 
peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 
a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late . 
the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming . 
the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication . 
kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
do you say " hi " to your lover when you wake up in the morning ? 
director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks . 
'yes , that's right : it's forrest gump , angel of death . '
while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
a generic international version of a typical american horror film . 
crikey indeed . 
there's a lot of good material here , but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it . 
if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild . 
yet another iteration of what's become one of the movies' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally " superior " friends , family . . . 
this flat run at a hip-hop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines . 
surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
 . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
these two are generating about as much chemistry as an iraqi factory poised to receive a un inspector . 
just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation . 
the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing . 
in the book-on-tape market , the film of " the kid stays in the picture " would be an abridged edition
it's just a little too self-satisfied . 
mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . 
brisk hack job . 
alarms for duvall's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks . 
what little grace [rifkin's] tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics . 
unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks " the four feathers " bare . 
falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice . 
one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . 
eight legged freaks ? no big hairy deal . 
laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany . 
'this movie sucks . '
 . . . bibbidy-bobbidi-bland . 
bad in such a bizarre way that it's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste . 
hugh grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are . 
i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama . 
the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake . 
there are now two signs that m . night shyamalan's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : unbreakable and signs . 
 . . . a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off . 
plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo . 
a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you're going to alter the bard's ending , you'd better have a good alternative . 
the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film . 
there is so much plodding sensitivity . 
 . . . too sappy for its own good . 
as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away' sinks . 
expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished . 
[javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama . 
adults , other than the parents . . . will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild . 
in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
a direct-to-void release , heading nowhere . 
below is well below expectations . 
 . . . standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added . 
given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube . 
jonathan parker's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films . 
unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties . 
a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks . 
you leave feeling like you've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing . 
with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd . 
in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life . 
the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned . 
sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and judaism back at least 50 . 
might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper . 
a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground . 
the actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face . 
however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . 
the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' . 
the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once . 
so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic . 
an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter . 
the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 
the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack . 
ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole . 
a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . 
a film with a great premise but only a great premise . 
kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . ( kirshner wins , but it's close . ) 
what started out as a taut contest of wills between bacon and theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence . 
an ugly , pointless , stupid movie .

much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here .

sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it doesn't .

the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 
in its chicken heart , crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises . 
the film is flat .

the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not . 
it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary .

an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 
this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen .

a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . '
a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort . 
despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . 
an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance . 
a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well .

it's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 
cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes . 
the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
it is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style . 
a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial . 
shreve's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera . 
nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .

first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it's kinda dumb . and second , what's with all the shooting ? 
there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .

it gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions . 
a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .

the only question . . . is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . average , at best , i'm afraid . 
a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing . 
overall , it's a pretty mediocre family film . 
in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .

a chiller resolutely without chills . 
the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio .

it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride . 
the story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed . 
i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes . 
none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
the whole film has this sneaky feel to it  as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product .

the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
'men in black ii creates a new threat for the mib , but recycles the same premise . 
feels familiar and tired . 
instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources  good sources , bad mixture
a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . 
it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland . 
completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
horrible

the only thing to fear about " fear dot com " is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film . 
'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree .

the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal . 
 . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . 
a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale .

shallow , noisy and pretentious . 
granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek . 
it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun . 
a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
hollywood ending just isn't very funny . 
a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore . 
two hours of junk . 
self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 
the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey . . . [it] comes off like a hallmark commercial . 
the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 
the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient . 
i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him . 
this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer . 
though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . 
diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling . 
brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 
utter mush . . . conceited pap . 
like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six . 
its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like . . . but overall the halloween series has lost its edge . 
the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 
generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it's not without style . 
it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . 
once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . 
it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .

boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 
the comedy is nonexistent . 
it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate . 
this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience . 
stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about . 
don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action . 
to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 
the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it . 
the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
 . . . will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks . after seeing the film , i can tell you that there's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it . 
as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done . but , for that , why not watch a documentary ? 
nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film . . . it's not even a tv special you'd bother watching past the second commercial break . 
you can see where big bad love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there . 
it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor .

the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface . 
in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled . 
largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
the result is an 'action film' mired in stasis . 
patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary . 
so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it . 
hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work .

it's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by elizabeth hurley in a bathing suit . 
too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet . 
director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters .

a clichd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men . 
a little weak -- and it isn't that funny .

your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make .

'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '
a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
who are 'they' ? well , they're 'they' . they're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . they exist for hushed lines like " they're back ! " , " they're out there ! " and " they're coming ! " 
were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '
i'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i don't see the point . it's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed . 
murder by numbers just doesn't add up . 
video games are more involving than this mess . 
a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller . 
the adventure doesn't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 . 
a mess . the screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen . 
before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg's adaptation of mary gaitskill's harrowing short story . . . is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . 
seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago . 
you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer . thumbs down . 
 . . . del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . 
the real question this movie poses is not 'who ? ' but 'why ? '
a movie that's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts . 
occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story . 
moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
ice age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ? 
 . . . they missed the boat . 
laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material . 
cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time . 
nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows . 
feels less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series . 
if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but wasn't , guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor . 
mediocre fable from burkina faso . 
since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things . 
fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies , and he gives none to the audience . 
nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! ) into scrooge . 
full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , kung pow ! is the kind of movie that's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low . 
there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations . where's the movie here ? 
lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs . 
buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichs and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
it's so badly made on every level that i'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it . 
nicks , seemingly uncertain what's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy . 
if there's one thing this world needs less of , it's movies about college that are written and directed by people who couldn't pass an entrance exam . 
[e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie . 
in its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of grease , without benefit of song . 
it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn . 
christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire . 
they should have called it gutterball . 
it's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . 
less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins . 
taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes . 
by turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious . 
villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) . 
it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . 
i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
too much of the humor falls flat . 
van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers . 
very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in " stuart little 2 " : there's just no story , folks . 
no way i can believe this load of junk . 
it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary . 
the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichd , doddering , misogynistic boy's club . 
full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . 
this movie is maddening . it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought . 
the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner . 
the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it . 
 is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful . 
velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene . 
because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , 'swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling . 
a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that . 
involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters . 
it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake . 
despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse . 
this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . 
once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back . 
if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . 
it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie . 
expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery . 
the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . 
zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight . 
while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold . 
though catch me if you can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie . 
a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba . 
so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie . 
the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power . 
almost gags on its own gore . 
it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show . 
while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . 
too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped . 
hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty . 
this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . 
in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest . 
well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . 
while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy . 
yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
not only unfunny , but downright repellent . 
forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . 
k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension . 
a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking . 
uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 
made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
holden caulfield did it better . 
oh come on . like you couldn't smell this turkey rotting from miles away . 
simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy . 
it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they're being streamed over a 28k modem . 
makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically . 
it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . 
in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space . 
a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film . 
scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence . it's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job . 
barely gets off the ground . 
pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut . 
from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura's best work since the xfl . 
a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) . 
too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . 
dilbert without the right-on satiric humor . 
do not see this film . 
delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas . 
to call the other side of heaven " appalling " would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be . 
if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con . 
without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these . 
to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment . 
it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation . 
not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions . 
once [kim] begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard . 
what's next : " my mother the car ? " 
a sequel that's much too big for its britches . 
what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution . 
a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route . 
the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 
rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment . 
paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat . 
this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against . 
the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second . 
too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization . 
it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
 . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . 
the film's essentially over by the meet-cute . 
it's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think . socrates motions for hemlock . 
walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . 
it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong . 
i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all . 
 . . . although this idea is " new " the results are tired . 
an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . 
don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk . 
the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation . 
a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug . 
vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 
feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work . 
given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done . 
a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal . 
it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense . 
[director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short . 
no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . 
there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .

comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief . 
stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green's half-hearted movie career . 
if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction . 
 . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos . 
a non-mystery mystery . 
what an embarrassment . 
in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius . 
the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one . 
it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull . 
director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback . 
outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . 
it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
new best friend's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous . 
the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant . 
while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . 
this isn't even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon . 
 . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . . 
an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
 . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
one long string of cliches . 
fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race . 
nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
at once half-baked and overheated . 
i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough . 
by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , . . . actually pretty good . of course , by more objective measurements it's still quite bad . 
sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids . 
woefully pretentious . 
a momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year . 
dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled . 
 . . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this " un-bear-able " project ! 
it's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel . 
some of it is clever , but it is never melodic/
better to just call it abc kiarostami . for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery . 
manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious . 
this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well . 
as vulgar as it is banal . 
you wonder why enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . 
the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second . 
tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple  he's understated and sardonic , she's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better . 
coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit . 
sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you . 
teen movies have really hit the skids . 
 . . . plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller . 
what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting . 
it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color . 
the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . 
like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter . 
for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen . 
 . . . plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . 
combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he's shooting the latest system of a down video . 
works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . 
nonsensical , dull " cyber-horror " flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting . 
manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane . 
there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . 
whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project . 
there isn't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients . 
directed in a paint-by-numbers manner . 
a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan . 
 . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else . 
this time mr . burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . 
it's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth . 
is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me . 
if you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever . 
adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized . but what are adults doing in the theater at all ? 
it's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue . 
partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show . 
portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama . 
jason x is positively anti-darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on auto-pilot . 
at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave . 
as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 
there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others . 
one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution . 
the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
stale , futile scenario . 
a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment . 
it's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt . 
another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 
i can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it . 
though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived . 
the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . 
makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun . 
bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad . 
if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , don't settle for this imposter . 
the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died . 
the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves . 
historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material . 
nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle . 
there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . 
mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . 
skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt . 
hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story . 
exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise . 
mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy . 
a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes . 
i'm just too bored to care . 
not a stereotype is omitted nor a clich left unsaid . 
attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience . 
nervous breakdowns are not entertaining . 
a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . 
this is so bad . 
i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example . 
this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers . 
every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife . 
is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . 
some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . 
comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn . 
demands too much of most viewers . 
it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
aggravating and tedious . 
the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt . 
a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy . 
the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue . 
remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more . 
this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller . 
lacks depth . 
there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to . 
under-rehearsed and lifeless
you can practically smell the patchouli oil . 
the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance . 
the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden . 
tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool . 
uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . 
the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . 
stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd . 
culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character . 
 . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself . 
the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie . 
this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ? 
equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect . 
audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning . 
i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland's class for the music , or to robin williams's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve . 
an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . 
yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature . 
this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . 
literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . 
anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss . 
a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world . 
the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically . 
when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . 
the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business . 
a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . 
instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be . 
flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern's thick , working-class scottish accent . 
the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through . 
nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichs and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera . 
might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage . 
arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces . 
the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary . 
we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 . 
[t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context . 
there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut . 
anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films . 
not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies . 
the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person . 
it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension . 
there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me . 
an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent . 
de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest . 
that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . 
if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be " how does steven seagal come across these days ? " or maybe " how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? 
the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay . 
dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick . 
flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams . 
the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending . 
for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet . 
ihops don't pile on this much syrup . 
focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her " madness " so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device . 
a bit of an unwieldy mess . 
the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . 
a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned . 
 . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
largely a for-fans artifact . 
characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better . 
[i]f you've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you've already seen this kind of thing . 
no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either . 
a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
when the first few villians are introduced as " spider " and " snake " you know you're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak . 
the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
so few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler . 
watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject . 
could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence . 
the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare . 
the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
[it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy . 
the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case . 
a sour , nasty offering . 
obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script . 
earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material . 
pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick . 
do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor . 
much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . 
'carente de imaginacin , mal dirigida , peor actuada y sin un pice de romance , es una verdadera prdida de tiempo y dinero'
both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie .

i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't . 
like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .

where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags . 
lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose . 
perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 
somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional . 
is " ballistic " worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer .

some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations . 
offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents
accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours . 
great story , bad idea for a movie .

all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters . 
this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few . 
considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
so clichd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart . 
it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three's company-style laugh track . 
credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment . 
[davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race . 
bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . 
when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that's a bad sign . a very bad sign . 
can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere . 
god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse . 
undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof . 
rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on " the simpsons " has . 
the movie bounces all over the map . 
not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs . 
it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original . 
 . . . salaciously simplistic . 
some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one . 
the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized . 
begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant . 
director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of " the longest yard " playbook like a checklist . 
oh , it's extreme , all right . extremely dumb . extremely confusing . extremely boring . 
for a shoot-'em-up , ballistic is oddly lifeless . 
what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ? 
opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled " glory : a soldier's story . " 
these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . 
a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan . 
how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $100 million on this ? 
with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . 
a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion . 
it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu . 
the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected . 
falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny . 
anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going . 
demme's loose approach kills the suspense . 
[plays] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy . 
nothing more than a mediocre trifle . 
too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette . 
trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness . 
its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
 . . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might . 
not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny . 
life is a crock -- or something like it . 
despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum . 
bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that . 
given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much . 
philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach . 
all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto . 
first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction . 
it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw . 
so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . 
even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
too close to phantom menace for comfort . 
although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke . 
this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . 
melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back . 
a real clunker . a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless . 
the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety . 
a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason . 
lawrence preaches strictly to the converted . 
will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings . 
choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy . 
the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .

adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse . 
beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness . 
unless you are in dire need of a diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it . wait for video -- and then don't rent it . 
there's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about . 
when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested . 
the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them . 
the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 
if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil . 
too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless . 
what is captured during the conceptual process doesn't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form . 
had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno . 
any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment . 
about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable . 
flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey . 
suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video . 
a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience . 
shouldn't have been allowed to use the word " new " in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie . 
the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud . 
reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing . 
eh . 
the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future . 
this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career . 
though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following . 
no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin . 
the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial . 
the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny . 
its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . 
feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network . 
credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) . 
rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next . 
i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing . 
the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs . 
all the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi . 
there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming . 
no movement , no yuks , not much of anything . 
thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired . 
the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through . 
plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights . 
quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ? 
what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination . 
high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character . 
de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
another rent installment for the ian fleming estate . 
so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . 
has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags . 
 " the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat . 
sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks . 
this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay . 
the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point . 
needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
madonna still can't act a lick . 
if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour . 
though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear . 
intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area . 
director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle . 
suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal . 
movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . 
i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence . 
mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama . 
aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing [the movie's] mindset . 
home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice . 
passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings . 
truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before . 
even die-hard fans of japanese animation . . . will find this one a challenge . 
the movie gets muted and routine . 
it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich . 
automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off . 
ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue . 
elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one . 
 in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction . 
the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging . 
men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . . 
an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living . 
after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna . 
two-bit potboiler . 
maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't . 
the film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place . 
a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . 
this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience . 
there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast . 
for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero . 
if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public . 
places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller . 
a very average science fiction film . 
how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us . 
the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . 
ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight . 
as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure . 
for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . 
while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . 
preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . 
as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame . 
 . . . has virtually no script at all . . . 
this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation . 
the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted . 
liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 
the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie
blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . 
all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click . 
formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble . 
the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . 
what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
 " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . 
a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . 
a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . 
it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 
a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising . 
it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original . 
the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it . 
maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this . 
the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough . 
just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . 
national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
ecks this one off your must-see list . 
the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted . 
just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . 
every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 
everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey . 
herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . 
beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
the film's center will not hold . 
too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise . 
dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 
as an actor , the rock is aptly named . 
i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch . 
johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to . 
the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover . 
the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller . 
you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad . 
george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release . 
what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent . 
 . . . too dull to enjoy . 
here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about . 
the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . 
de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
the marquis de sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be . 
the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets . 
showtime is closer to slowtime . 
the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
it's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script . 
an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality . 
painfully padded . 
[morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism . 
passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless . 
my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .

blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel . 
the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense . 
mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values .

that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout . 
for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them . 
sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .

a wordy wisp of a comedy . 
[seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie .

we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side . 
schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .

sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .

this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie . 
halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy . 
authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow . 
control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible
the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
 . . . no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch . 
kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste . 
 . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism . 
as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising . 
to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
the good is very , very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 
be forewarned , if you're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards . 
an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
dramatically lackluster . 
a gushy episode of " m * a * s * h " only this time from an asian perspective .

good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
 . . . one resurrection too many . 
demeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material . 
no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
a timid , soggy near miss . 
to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson . 
with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . 
 . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges . 
goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . 
the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc . -- to do the subject matter justice . 
this is not a jackie chan movie . it's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . and that makes all the difference . 
the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness . 
i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
a negligible british comedy .

a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly . 
you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time . 
yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references . 
like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again . 
the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
director david fincher and writer david koepp can't sustain it . 
a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . 
the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief . 
strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . 
devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . 
a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather .

hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff . 
a pretentious mess .

[taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb . 
lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis . 
the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank . 
the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs . 
barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . 
one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact . 
the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters . 
hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry . 
it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring .

these characters become wearisome . 
this may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar .

contrived pastiche of caper clichs . 
just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless . 
yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other's existence . 
i can't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there's only one problemit's supposed to be a drama . 
well , jason's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , don't shoot the messenger ) . 
there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract . 
frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for . 
the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her .

arty gay film . 
an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay . 
there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
incoherence reigns . 
the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they won't much care about . 
this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .

a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .

a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
[soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag .

very stupid and annoying . 
a listless and desultory affair . 
how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly .

helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market . 
apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .

co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . 
a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
an uninspired preachy and clichd war film . 
a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people .

[seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price . 
what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
 " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes .

the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between .

choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '
a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .

tends to plod . 
gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic . 
with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral .

humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me . 
nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
overly long and worshipful bio-doc . 
writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 
everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way . 
less than fresh . 
the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull . 
a road trip that will get you thinking , 'are we there yet ? '
dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 
the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movieif only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch . 
is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ? 
the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material .

so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen . 
ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous . 
it's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name . 
even murphy's expert comic timing and famed charisma can't rescue this effort . 
a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . 
a lame comedy . 
a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be . 
on its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc . , without the latter's imagination , visual charm or texture . 
it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle . 
the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one . 
too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 
it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one . 
the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it . 
the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 
like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
 . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . 
one of the worst films of 2002 . 
plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood . 
high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 
an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy . 
instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized . 
i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 
the film doesn't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia . 
after an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be . 
a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material . 
like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 
snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this . 
any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 
things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .

we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 
'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .

chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe . 
comes across as a fairly weak retooling . 
its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .

has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital . 
[allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 
mildly amusing . 
the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it weren't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension . 
the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters . 
merchant hasn't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage . 
more a gunfest than a rock concert . 
a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here . 
it's not original enough . 
terrible . 
degenerates into hogwash . 
julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent . 
the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy . 
it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting . 
all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
with little visible talent and no energy , colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .

everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
 coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [franois and michle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . 
collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence . 
attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it . 
 . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 
most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . 
rather less than the sum of its underventilated pre-fils confrontations . 
plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 
a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 
whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . 
unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung . 
knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail . 
it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 
for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence . 
an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . 
for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . 
lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else . 
an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 
meandering and confusing . 
ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel isn't the actor to save it . 
 . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . 
how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 
handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked souffl . 
a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though don't ask still finds a few chuckles . 
often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . 
elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . 
i have no problem with " difficult " movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out . but first , you have to give the audience a reason to <b>want</b> to put for that effort , and " i
what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . 
fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers . 
none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens . 
'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '
the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . 
with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen . . . his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles . 
what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release . 
it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 
seriously , rent the disney version . 
like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest . it can't escape its past , and it doesn't want to . 
problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on . 
a loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . 
the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 
a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering . 
the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 
while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out " when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , " it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to " tonight . " 
the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years . 
more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 
[johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers . 
it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut , mad cows . 
its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 
unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
a bad movie that happened to good actors . 
boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . 
it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 
if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
[t]he ideas of revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 
even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 
one thing's for sureif george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
one of the worst movies of the year . 
it wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo . 
i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
makes 98 minutes feel like three hours . 
aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 
the title , alone , should scare any sane person away . 
appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites . 
one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once . 
let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears . 
an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 
the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . 
maid in manhattan proves that it's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies . 
i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
amazingly lame . 
like most of jaglom's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand . 
forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
 . . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 
cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses  and ours  and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 
an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal . 
instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics . 
becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . 
two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending . 
the entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 
the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
a complete waste of time . 
do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 
tennessee williams by way of oprah's book club . 
the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . 
this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids . 
some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny . 
witless and utterly pointless . 
show me the mugging . 
visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying . 
a guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it . 
with a " spy kids " sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a " snl " has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago . 
statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british . 
initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience . 
dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
[toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material . 
essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . 
the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence . 
this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it . 
a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story . 
the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . 
starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning . 
its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure . 
nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . 
[tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
long before it's over , you'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser . 
hollywood's answer to an air ball . 
such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 
there is nothing funny in this every-joke-has- been-told-a- thousand-times- before movie . 
this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
there's an admirable rigor to jimmy's relentless anger , and to the script's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there's no place for this story to go but down . 
a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures . 
such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution . 
this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious . 
rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic . 
so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind .

the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others' affections . 
[a] poorly executed comedy . 
what we have here isn't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down . 
a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing . 
this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least . 
scotland , pa is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept . 
not only does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes .

it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
'in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess . 
get out your pooper-scoopers . 
it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting . 
more busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining . 
 . . . really horrible drek . 
the fourth in a series that i'll bet most parents had thought --hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . 
its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
more precious than perspicacious
[t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 
enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise . yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . 
starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 
perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . 
memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual . 
in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . 
it appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making . 
snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . 
starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success . 
a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer . 
green ruins every single scene he's in , and the film , while it's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that . 
the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling . 
resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws . 
a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock . 
a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with . 
it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up . 
hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud . 
a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets . 
this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine . 
ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clich of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability . 
tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours . 
suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 
fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . 
it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle . 
the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen--and a hollywood-ized austen at that . 
ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on . 
cherry orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a 'back story . '
a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent . 
while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . 
 sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving . 
it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
 . . . feels as if ( there's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
flat , misguided comedy . 
the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . 
a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily . 
lurid and less than lucid work . 
at a brief 42 minutes , we need more x and less blab . 
this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny . 
the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice . 
return to never land is much more p . c . than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing .

slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious . 
in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 . 
a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
ah , the travails of metropolitan life ! alas , another breathless movie about same ! 
though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious . 
despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
 " not really as bad as you might think ! " 
one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 
its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . 
an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man . 
in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the " queen " and less of the " damned . " 
kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) . 
none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective . 
a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it's the butt of its own joke . 
in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz . 
perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
an encouraging effort from mccrudden
if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option . 
adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 
a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally . 
with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
dull , a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 
predictably melodramatic . 
a relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale . 
adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all . 
too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets . 
the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you . 
despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products . 
the movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself . 
disappointing in comparison to other recent war moviesor any other john woo flick for that matter . 
'opening up' the play more has partly closed it down . 
an ugly , revolting movie . 
the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i can't remember a single name responsible for it . 
certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
the skills of a calculus major at m . i . t . are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy who is cletis tout ? 
my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack . 
filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . 
the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . 
supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest . 
the smash 'em-up , crash 'em-up , shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense . 
hart's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently can't quite decide which character . 
this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
the beautiful , unusual music is this film's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . 
forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go . 
'es en verdad una pena que mandoki est realizando cintas tan malas desde hace algn tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero quin sabe dnde lo tiene escondido . '
another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting . 
it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much . 
the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events . 
press the delete key . 
once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional . 
there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
the threat implied in the title pokmon 4ever is terrifying  like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 
to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it . 
the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups . 
mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 
a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 
fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
woody , what happened ? 
it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah . 
throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
routine and rather silly . 
totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire . 
the film's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting . 
the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 
rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 
the pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated . 
 . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
a well-acted , but one-note film . 
the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications . 
there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
a era do gelo diverte , mas no convence .  um passatempo descompromissado  e s . 
it's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment . 
ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
we started to wonder if  some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock , ' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine . 
more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat . 
when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble . 
marinated in clichs and mawkish dialogue . 
[a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine . 
not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling . 
nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . 
remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 
this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
if they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands i kept looking for the last exit from brooklyn . 
a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis . 
the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted . 
definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum . 
although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichs the filmmakers could dredge up . 
it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned . 
it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 
stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? 
the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so . 
it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy . 
like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
competently directed but terminally cute drama . 
not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever . 
those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen . 
the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 
a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence . 
spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together . 
the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . 
an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often . 
time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me . 
has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9  weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . 
the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted . 
the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amlie . 
ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy . 
a minor-league soccer remake of the longest yard . 
as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 
there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men . 
it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 
the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york . 
harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . 
[lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .

unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , impostor is opening today at a theater near you . 
chen films the resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book . 
far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love . 
i was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither . 
soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence . 
all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . 
rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naf's encounter with the world . 
it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it . 
the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters . 
the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . 
it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs . 
the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
did we really need a remake of " charade ? " 
the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel . 
bearable . barely . 
an " o bruin , where art thou ? " -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack . 
an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 
the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary . 
a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality

a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way . 
'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 
blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . 
staggeringly dreadful romance . 
final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
if a few good men told us that we " can't handle the truth " than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we " don't care about the truth . " 
you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy . 
this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .

debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish . 
the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . 
the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies .

well-made but mush-hearted . 
the film is strictly routine . 
skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down . 
barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
we get the comedy we settle for . 
two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning . 
the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . 
the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork . 
manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new . 
true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
